    info:
      "Samsung built the Galaxy Note brand on delivering the best big-screen phones around, but the best thing about the new Samsung Galaxy Note 10 is how delightfully small it is. The 6.3-inch Note 10 is one of the most compact big-screen phones yet, thanks to its nearly bezel-free Infinity-O screen — and some features Samsung left on the cutting room floor. The Note 10 also boasts several S-Pen enhancements (including gestures), new video recording features and a new way to mirror the phone on a PC. ",

    company: "ONEPLUS ",
    info:
      "OnePlus has always made stylish-looking handsets, since way back in 2014 when it first got started with the OnePlus One. That design heritage shines through in the OnePlus 7T Pro, from the 6.67-inch, 1,440 x 3,120 pixel, 19.5:9 aspect ratio, AMOLED screen, to the pop-up motorised selfie camera. That pop-up camera – which appears and disappears automatically as you switch in and out of selfie mode – means no need for a notch on the front display. With its minimal bezels and slightly curved edges, it's a great phone to look at, and is likely to turn heads when you pull it out.  Around the back we like the positioning of the triple-lens rear camera, and the slight gradient of the haze blue colour (your only colour option with the OnePlus 7T Pro) looks fantastic, too. It may have been playing catch up for a few years but there's no doubt that OnePlus is now helping lead the way in smartphone design. The OnePlus 7T Pro feels smooth and comfortable in the hand, though the size of the screen means you really need two hands to operate it. In terms of the display, it's crisp and bright to look at, with excellent sharpness and contrast, and a 90Hz refresh rate for super-smooth scrolling and gaming.",

    company: "GOOGLE",
    info:
      "The Pixel 4’s standout feature is its software, which closes the gap between itself and the competition, along with an improved pair of cameras that will show you everything your heart desires, even the stars in the night sky. No, really, this phone can take pictures of stars, as long as you’re in the right place at the right time. The Pixel 4 (and, in this particular review, the 4 XL) feels at times like the most incremental revision imaginable, one that could’ve been made with a software update. But a bit of new hardware gives the Pixel 4, and Google’s AI-powered services, more to work with, and enough to make you say “wow!” after you snap a photo you didn’t think was possible.",

    info:
      "For the longest time, Microsoft's mystery machine codenamed Project Scorpio promised to be the most powerful gaming console around, capable of delivering native 4K gaming and support for HDR10. But it's not just that elusive 4K promise. Microsoft says multiplatform games will look and perform the best on the Xbox One X ($329 at Amazon) and legacy Xbox One ($418 at Walmart) games will play better too. No 4K TV? No problem. Microsoft also says the Xbox One X will use supersampling to downscale a 4K signal to 1080p so those who don't yet own a 4K TV will still enjoy the benefits of improved visual fidelity.",

    info:
      "Fujifilm's X-T30 brings the same 26MP sensor, processor and much of the feature set of the high-end X-T3 at a more reasonable price. If that sounds familiar, it's because the relationship between the X-T20 and X-T2 was the same.  With the X-T30 you get Fujifilm's latest AF system, along with plenty of direct controls and a tilting touchscreen, all in a smaller body. The X-T30 also comes at a significantly lower price than the X-T3, with the body priced at $899, versus $1499 for the X-T3. We'll discuss what features were cut in order to make the X-T30 the less expensive of the two options a bit later in the review.",
